desc: "The Fifty-One Ladies International Gëlle Fra is a club with an international
  vocation. The spoken languages are English and Luxembourgish (any other language
  of course being welcome). The dinner meetings take place every second Wednesday
  of the month, from Jan. to July and from Sept. to Dec., usually at the Restaurant
  \"Firwat Net\" in Cents. In those months with 5 Wednesdays, the fifth Wednesday
  is a men's night.  \n  \nPurpose   \n\"Supporting social projects through friendship,
  respect and tolerance\".   \nWithout considering philosophical, racial or political
  issues, the Fifty-One International works towards a better understanding between
  people by helping them to know and appreciate each other more while serving a common
  cause.   \nThe Ladies’ club will put the focus on the \"networking\" aspect by organizing
  conferences and meetings, in order to connect and exchange with other women/men
  and potential new members.  \n  \nOrganization   \nThe club is composed of members
  united in the interest of serving a common cause. An elected committee consisting
  of a President, a Vice-President, a Secretary, a Treasurer and a Protocol Lady is
  in charge of the organizational tasks of the club.  \n  \nWho can be a member? 
  \ \nAs is common practice in service clubs one does not apply to become a member
  of a Fifty-One club. You have to be invited by a friend and qualify to become a
  member. Independently of the indispensable requirement of honorability, the club
  must assure itself of the candidates sincere motivation to contribute to the aims
  of the group, and help the service to the community locally, nationally and internationally."
